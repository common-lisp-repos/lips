* lips: The non-dumb text preprocessor

  One sultry summer's afternoon, I tried to write an essay using Markdown. I wanted to have references, and I didn't want to have to manually update the reference IDs to maintain numerical order if I moved text around. Attempting to use the C preprocessor for Markdown immediately didn't go well, and then I tried m4. m4 was much better, but it failed when I tried to pass arguments to a macro that contained commas. Either it doesn't work at all or it's too hard to figure out how to quote stuff, so I dumped it and wrote an extremely simple preprocessor in Common Lisp that doesn't have these problems.

** Usage

   All text passes through the preprocessor unaltered except when prefixed by a =~= character. The =~= character interprets the subsequent text as a lisp object and evaluates it, printing the result of the evaluation.

   If the subsequent character is whitespace, the evaluation of a form consumes it without printing it. This is so that, for example, function definitions do not needlessly cause newlines to be emitted.

   To cause lips to emit a literal =~= character in your writing, escape it by prefixing it with another =~= like so: =~~=.

   The values to which function calls evaluate are printed, but the functions can print things themselves with things like =FORMAT= and =PRINC= as well.

** Functions

*** =INCLUDE-TEXT= /filename/ => /nothing/

    Treats the contents of the file /filename/ as if they had appeared in place of the call to =INCLUDE-TEXT=.

*** =INCLUDE-DEFS= /filename/ => /nothing/

    Loads the given /filename/ as plain Common Lisp source code.

** Convenience functions

*** =DEFUN-Q= /name/ /lambda-list/ /body.../ => /nothing/

    Same as =defun= except it does not evaluate to the name of the function.

*** =DEFPARAMETER-Q= /name/ /value/ => /nothing/

    Same as =defparameter= except it does not evaluate to the name of the variable.

*** =SETF-Q= /place/ /value/ => /nothing/

    Same as =SETF= but without a return value.

*** =ADD-FINISH-HOOK= /function/ => /nothing/

    Adds the function to the beginning of a list of functions that are called when the end of the input stream is reached.

** Variables

*** =*PARAGRAPH-SEPARATOR*=

    This value or function is printed or called, if non-NIL, whenever two consecutive newlines are encountered.

** Examples

*** Simple example

    Input:

#+BEGIN_SRC
ohayou~~~~~~
#+END_SRC

    Output:

#+BEGIN_SRC
ohayou~~~
#+END_SRC

*** Variable definition

    Input:

#+BEGIN_SRC
~(defparameter-q blah "text")
~blah
#+END_SRC

    Output:

#+BEGIN_SRC
text
#+END_SRC

*** Function definition

    Input:

#+BEGIN_SRC
~(defun-q add (&rest nums)
    (format t "Sum of ~{~a ~}: " nums)
    (apply #'+ nums))
~(add 1 2 3)
#+END_SRC

    Output:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Sum of 1 2 3 : 6
#+END_SRC

*** Finish hooks

    Input:

#+BEGIN_SRC
~(add-finish-hook (lambda () "Bye there!"))
Hi there!
#+END_SRC

    Output:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Hi there!
Bye there!
#+END_SRC

*** Executing arbitrary lisp code

    The true power of using lisp as a preprocessor is evident when writing more complicated definitions. If using SBCL, this example must be run without the =--no-userinit= flag because it causes ASDF not to be loaded.

    Input:

#+BEGIN_SRC
~(progn
    (asdf:load-system :drakma)

    (let ((input (drakma:http-request "http://google.com"
                                      :want-stream t)))
        #| Use input... |#
        (close input)))
#+END_SRC

** Compatibility

   I have only tested lips with SBCL, but it shouldn't be using any platform-specific code, so others should be fine. Pull requests for compatibility fixes are welcome.
